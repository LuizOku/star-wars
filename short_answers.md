**1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make us the right next step in your career?**  
Recently I became a dad; my daughter is 7 months old, and it completely changed my perspective. Throughout my career I have thrived in small startups, loving the fast-paced environment, the ownership, and the opportunity to grow by learning from teammates and contributing technically, to the business, and by sharing knowledge. However, the startup world can be unstable, and as a father I want to provide security and stability for my family.

What excites me about LawnStarter is that it feels like the perfect combination: a larger, more established company offering stability, but with a culture that still values ownership, fast-paced challenges, and collaborative growth. From my interviews and everything I have learned, LawnStarter seems like the ideal place to build my career while contributing meaningfully.

**2. What have you learned so far about us that has excited you?**  
I learned that LawnStarter gives engineers room to grow and supports them in developing new skills. During my conversations, I mentioned that I have little experience with PHP, and it was great to hear that this isn’t a barrier because you value the ability and willingness to learn. I also discovered that LawnStarter encourages growth in both technical and soft skills, and I appreciate that the company is expanding, which creates opportunities for personal and professional development. Completing the take-home assignment using PHP for the backend was already an exciting chance to start learning, and it made me even more excited about the possibility of growing with the team.

**3. Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? Are you comfortable with that?**  
Yes, throughout my career I have worked in startups where developers were responsible for delivering features end-to-end, including deploying and monitoring in production. I am very comfortable with this approach because I enjoy fast-paced environments where teams trust each other’s professionalism and commitment. Owning the full lifecycle makes me more careful with every change I make, and I believe it leads to higher-quality software and a stronger sense of accountability.

**4. What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?**  
I am excited to go deeper into PHP, especially after using it in the take-home assignment, which was a great learning experience. I also want to continue improving my frontend skills and explore new frameworks like Astro, which are bringing amazing performance gains. Additionally, I want to study AI more seriously. I know it’s a common topic today, but I want to understand better how tools like large language models, generative AI, and retrieval-augmented generation can help me become a better engineer in my daily work.
